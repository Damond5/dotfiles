# TODO
- Never execute tasks directly by main agent
  - Always use the main agent as an orchestrator
  - This way the orchestrator can help a stuck subagent
  - Always delegate tasks
  - Specify which subagents to use for which tasks
  - Always evaluate a subagent task for completion after it is done, then make the subagent continue the task if it is not complete
    - Does this mean we dont need the evaluate plugin?
  - Missing subagents
    - Coding
    - More?
