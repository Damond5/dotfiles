# TODO

## Task Completion Monitor
- Change console.log when no password found to be an opencode notification instead (NOT notify-send notification)
  - Also change console.log when sesssion interrupted
- Make sure completion analysis sees a planning task as fully completed when the analysis is done and doesnt start building
- Does it trigger falsely on sub agents?

## User Input Notifier
- Notification always says "Permission required for undefined on undefined"
